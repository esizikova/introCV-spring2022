Course webpage for the NYU Spring 2022 Course Special Topics in Data Science, DS-GA 3001.003/.004 (Introduction to Computer Vision). This course is aims to cover a broad topics in computer vision, and is *not* primarily a deep learning course. We will covert topics in traditional computer vision such as camera geometry, image formation, segmentation, object recognition, classification, and detection (see [Syllabus](#Syllabus)).


### Logistics

* DS-GA 3001.003 (Lecture) \
Thursdays 4:55pm-6:35pm  \
**Location**: Global Center for Academic & Spiritual Life, 238 Thompson Street (GCASL 361)   \
\
The class will be in-person. Slides will be available after the class on this webpage. (see [Schedule](#Schedule)).

* DS-GA 3001.004 (Lab) \
Tuesdays 5:55pm-6:45pm \
**Location**: Global Center for Academic & Spiritual Life, 238 Thompson Street (GCASL 361)   \
\
Labs will be used to cover additional materials or to work through practical exercises with the TA. 

* **Office Hours**: \
Jean Ponce: TBA \
Alberto Bietti: TBA \
Elena Sizikova: TBA

* **Brightspace Link**: TBA  \
Please try first to post any questions about course logistics and material, HWs and final project on Brightspace. We also highly encourage you to help each other out (but please do not reveal answers). For additional questions, please email course staff.
